## Future Plans ðŸš€

Here are some of the features and improvements planned for future versions:

- **Wall Kicks**: Implement "wall kicks" to allow rotating pieces near the edge of the board by shifting them away from the wall if there is space.
- **Hold Queue**: Add a "hold" feature allowing the player to swap the current tetromino with a stored one using the Q and E (if two) keys, with a big score penalty for each swap, to make getting high score harder.
- **Seedable Games**: Introduce a seeding mechanism to allow for reproducible tetromino sequences, making specific challenges or races possible.
- **Replay System**: Track all game events to create a replay system, allowing players to watch and share their games.
- **Online Leaderboard**: Develop a global leaderboard to display high scores, complete with links to replays.
